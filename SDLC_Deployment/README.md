Welcome to our SDLC Deployment Workshop designed specifically for beginners. This workshop aims to introduce participants to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with a focus on the deployment phase. Through a mix of theoretical knowledge and practical exercises, participants will gain insights into the importance of SDLC in software engineering and learn how to deploy a simple application.

## Workshop Overview

During this 4-hour workshop, we will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to SDLC
- Phases of SDLC
- Deployment in SDLC
- Practical Exercise: Deploying a Simple Application

## Prerequisites and Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before attending this workshop, participants should have:

- Basic understanding of how websites and web applications work.
- Familiarity with using command line interfaces (CLI).
- An installed version of Git. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Git**: If you haven't already, please install Git from the link provided above. This will be essential for the version control section of the workshop.

2. **Sign up for a GitHub account**: We will be using GitHub to host the code for our practical exercises. If you do not have an account, sign up at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

3. **Download and install a code editor**: If you do not have a preferred code editor, we recommend Visual Studio Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) or Atom ([https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)).

4. **Create a workspace on your computer**: Make a new folder on your computer where you can store all workshop materials and exercises.

5. **Clone the workshop repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the workshop materials:

Note: Replace `<repository-link>` with the actual URL of the workshop repository.
